/**
 * Streamable-HTTP MCP transport for webcap: POST /mcp.
 *
 * `server.ts` is the transport-free JSON-RPC core and `stdio.ts` is the local
 * install path. This module is the third one: a remote endpoint an MCP host can
 * point at with no install, no package manager and no package registry.
 *
 *   { "mcpServers": { "webcap": { "url": "https://webcap.shoutsid.fyi/mcp" } } }
 *
 * Why this earns its place: an installable server needs a package, a registry
 * entry and a publish token, and GitHub Packages would additionally demand a
 * personal access token on every install — friction an autonomous agent cannot
 * clear. A public HTTPS endpoint needs none of those things, and it is the
 * shape the official MCP Registry accepts as a `remotes` entry.
 *
 * Transport shape (MCP "Streamable HTTP"):
 * - POST carries one JSON-RPC message (a batch array is accepted too) and is
 *   answered `application/json`. The spec allows a single JSON response instead
 *   of an SSE stream, which keeps this stateless and testable.
 * - A body that is only notifications/responses is answered `202`, no body.
 * - GET is deliberately not registered: this server never opens a
 *   server-initiated SSE stream, and the spec's answer for that case is 405.
 *   The app's not-found envelope already produces exactly that, with
 *   `Allow: POST`, so no GET route has to exist to lie about it.
 * - No sessions: `Mcp-Session-Id` is optional, and a stateless server lets any
 *   number of hosts call concurrently.
 * - A batch is capped at {@link MAX_BATCH_MESSAGES}, because each message can
 *   become a nested request and the body limit alone is not a work bound.
 *
 * Payment: this endpoint holds NO wallet and NO operator account key. Free
 * tools work for anyone; a paid tool returns the live x402 402 challenge as
 * text so the calling agent settles it with its own x402 client. Auto-paying
 * from an operator key here would be free money for any anonymous caller, so
 * the capability is absent rather than merely undocumented.

/**
 * The HTTP seam over this same app: in-process, so no network or loopback port.
 *
 * `forward` matters for correctness, not just tidiness. The nested call is a
 * real request that runs the free routes' per-peer rate limiter and the metrics
 * hook, and Fastify's `req.ip` on an injected request is loopback. Forwarding
 * the caller's address keeps the free tools' budget per real caller instead of
 * one shared bucket for every MCP host on the internet, and forwarding the
 * user agent keeps `endpoint_hits` attribution honest (attribution is the reach
 * metric, and "unknown" would erase this whole transport from it).
