/**
 * GET /v1/agent-funnel — the income funnel for the customer webcap actually
 * has: an autonomous agent.
 *
 * The legacy /v1/funnel tracks the human landing-page path (landing_view ->
 * preview_submit -> ...), which the traffic data shows is dead. This view
 * tracks the agent path instead, from the tables that already exist:
 *
 *   reach      discovery clients hitting the machine-readable surfaces
 *              (llms.txt, skill.md, /.well-known/*, openapi, x402 service)
 *   challenge  402s handed to paid routes (i.e. agents that found a price)
 *   trial      free trial claims (wallet-signed), the last no-cost step
 *   paid       settled calls + distinct paying wallets (revenue_ledger)
 *   retention  first-pay vs repeat wallets — one looping wallet is not demand
 *   recurring  watches holding credits (the recurring rail)
 *
 * Aggregate only: counts and client identities, never a raw payer address
 * (endpoint_hits stores a sha256 slice; trial_claims/revenue_ledger payers are
 * never returned). Public and unauthenticated, mirroring /v1/status.
 *
 * See docs/strategy/agent-first.md (north star) and docs/strategy/metrics.md.
